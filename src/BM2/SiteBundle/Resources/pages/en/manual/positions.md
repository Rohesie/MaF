Every realm you'll encounter will have at least one position, it's ruler, but there are many other positions that the ruler can add in order to expand the operation of the realm. Positions in Might & Fealty are left as abstract as possible, in order to allow you to create the realm you imagine. This means you can create a position

The details on this page are mainly for the ruler, so that they can understand how different Realm Position options affect the actual position, as well as detailing some future additions, but it can also be good for general awareness of the feature.

Basics
------
The position title and description are fairly straightforward. These are the name of the position, and the description of the position, respectively.

You also have the option of selecting a position type, which is, for now, entirely descriptive. If you have ideas for other types, please let us know.

Elections & Inheritance
-----------------------
Unlike the real world, in Might & Fealty, there are two conditions which can cause inheritance. Firstly, you've got death of a character, which should be expected. However, we understand that sometimes people leave, quit, or just can't play for an extended period, and collectively we refer to that in game as 'Slumberblight', which will also trigger inheritance.

If a given position is set to be inherited, it will always go to the heir of the character who held it when they died or slumbered, this takes priority over any elections. It also means that if a position is held by multiple people, when one of them passes they'll be replaced by their heir or heiress.

If the position is elected, and not inherited, the game will automatically call enough [elections] to restore the position to the number of minimum holders its configured to have, using the election type configured for that position.

If its neither elected nor inherited, it will be up to the ruler to appoint new individuals. In the future, it will be possible to configure a position to appoint holders to itself or other positions.

It is also possible, for non-ruler positions, to allow the position to be kept on slumber. We're not sure why you'd do this, but we added it as an option.

Routine Elections
-----------------
As we mentioned, when a position is missing holders, the game will call a new election to restore them.

However, you can also configure an election to run automatically on set dates. This is done by setting the position's term length, next election year, and next election week. When the year and week match the current in-game year and week, the game will call a "routine election" for the position. When one of these elections completes, they will replace all previous holders with all new ones, and reset the position's next election year and week according to the term length.
