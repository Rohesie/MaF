Operating somewhat similarly to a [settlement](settlements) and sharing some of the same options, Places of Interest, or simply just "Places", are locations on the map created by other players to describe a given building, space, or natural occurrence.

Places are controlled by a particular player, who can then control who has access to visit them or do things within. Furthermore, like settlements, they can entered with military forces or attacked in a [siege](sieges).

Places come in a number of different varieties, many of which will be expanded upon at a later date, and some of which can only be built inside or outside of a settlement. When you're in interaction distance, you'll be able to leave a message for the character responsible for the place. This can be the owner, the ruler of a realm, the lord, or a foreign ambassador, depending on the type of place you're at.

All places require permission of the lord to be built, either by having permission granted or being the lord. Some have further restrictions, like requiring a certain building, being inside or outside, or holding a particular type of position.

## Academies  
Placeable: In a future update.

In the upcoming Activities Update, academies will be able to be built if an academy is available in the settlement, and these Places will allow you to formally train other characters in a given [skill](skills), a set of skills, or a [style](styles), dependent on your own capabilities with that skill or style.

## Arenas
Placeable: In a future update.

In the upcoming Activities Update, arenas will allow you to fight captured monsters, animals, and prisoners in a staged arena for glory or riches.

## Capitals
Placeable: By the realm's ruler.

Capitals allow you to properly detail what your realm's seat of power actually looks like. Similarly to how capital regions are linked on a realm's info page, capital places are linked as well, if present.

Unlike most places, Capitals do not have a traditional owner that manages them, but are instead managed by any of the rulers of the owning realm.

## Castles
Placeable: Inside settlements by the lord.

Always wished you could describe how grim or dark or bright or interesting your lord's castle is? Castles have you covered.  

## Caves
Placeable: By anyone.

You can never be quite sure what you'll find in a cave. Sometimes it'll be a private getaway, other times a dragon. Occasionally, just a lot of rock.

## Embassies
Placeable: By anyone that is either holding a diplomatic position or is the ruler

One of the more complex places of interest, an Embassy can be created by rulers or holders of positions that handle foreign affairs. They themselves will be part of one realm, normally that of the region they are located in, hosted by a second realm, and owned/used by a third realm. The hosting realm is the realm the appointed owning realm's ambassador will be granted access to. This means that you can have one realm that contains an embassy (the realm the Embassy is part of), a second realm that leases the embassy for use (the hosting realm), and a third realm that uses it (the owning realm).

The owning realm will appoint the ambassador.

## Forts
Placeable: Outside a settlement by the lord or a character holding a military position.

Forts will allow you to garrison strategic points on the map and create a standing order for those stationed there to block travel of anyone passing by. There is not currently a scheduled update for these to be implemented.

## Homes
Placeable: By the head of a House.

Homes are the catch-all term for any place that is the main gathering point of a [house](houses), though in instances where there is no associated house they can be used as a regular descriptive manor or estate.

## Inns
Placeable: By anyone in a region that has an inn built, inside a settlement or not.

We're not entirely sure why you'd want to describe a particular inn, but we won't deny you the option. Unlike other places, these are considered public buildings, and cannot restrict entry.

## Libraries
Placeable: By anyone in a settlement that has a library built.

Similarly to inns, we're not entire sure why you'd want to describe a library in great detail, but you certainly can. Also, like inns, these are considered public buildings.

## Monuments
Placeable: By the lord.

Monuments are the catch all for any type of public space that serves as a memorial to some past achievement. These are considered a public space.

## Plazas
Placeable: By the lord.

Really, plazas are just any area dedicated to being an open space. Perhaps it's for a market, or for events, or just because you wanted a fountain in town.

## Passages
Placeable: By the GM.

Passages are interesting because you can never be too sure where they lead or whether or not you'll encounter a grue.

## Portals
Placeable: By the GM.

Portals are very like passages in that they link places, but very unlike passages in that the places they link don't always have to make logical sense. They might not even link the same worlds. Some hear rumors of portals that lead to a world with near annual invasions by monsters, undead, and even daimons!

## Tracks
Placeable: In a future update.

Likely coming as part of the Activities Update, tracks will allow formal racing events to held in a closed environment.

## Taverns
Placeable: By anyone in the region that has a tavern built, inside a settlement or not.

Taverns are where you can go for a meal and a drink. Some of these even host small shows from musicians or comedians.

## Tournament Grounds
Placeable: In a future update.

Coming as part of the Activities Update, tournament grounds will allow you to plan, coordinate, and participate in tournaments that test various [skills], be they melee, joust, or, yes, even *archery*.
