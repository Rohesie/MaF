One of the first extra-realm political units of Might & Fealty you might encounter is the *house*, which is a collection of First Ones united under their *Head of the House*.

Unlike other extra-realm polities, Houses are regarded as particular worthy of note, with the leadership of [realms] displaying the houses of their [ruler]s on realm pages, and [settlements] listing all locally established houses when visited.

Houses are also unique in that they have quite strict rules on inheritance, that ensure the leadership of the House never passes too far away from itself.

A final point to note, before going into how inheritance works, is that Houses can support a Superior/Cadet relationship between themselves, with one House becoming subservient to another.

Creating a House
----------------
Houses can be formalized by any First One that is not currently in a House by owning a Place of Interest of the "Home" type and being within it.

Once those requirements are met, they'll see an option on any of the politics menus (except relations) titled "Formalize Your House".

Similarly, any member of a House can petition the Head of their House to allow them to create a Cadet House. If this is accepted, they'll also be able to create a House when the regular conditions are met.

Precedence of Inheritance
-------------------------
First and foremost, all Heads of House have the right to declare a special Successor to their House. This Successor is declared separately from their own regular Heir as the rules are stricter on who may inherit.

If for some reason the declared Successor isn't a legal inheritor, which we'll cover momentarily, then the House may pass to the regular Heir of the character.

Lastly, should that heir also not be a legal inheritor, the House will pass to the oldest member within the House.

If for some reason, there's no one left in the House, it will fall to the pages of history.

Rules of Ineritance
-------------------
In all situations, the inheritor being reviewed must:

* Be Alive.
* Not be Slumbering.
* Not be Retired.

For Successors, they must also be:

* In the same House as the late Head.

For Heirs, they must also be:

* Either in the same House, or an immediate relative of the late Head and in ANY house.

By this, immediate relative is assumed to be any direct parent, sibling, or child of the character in question.

At this time, inheritance by an heir is the only way for one house to end up a Cadet of another, with the Superior house counting all direct and indirect (those in cadet houses) members as it's own.

Future Additions
----------------
House are a relatively new feature in Might & Fealty, and are not yet considered complete at this time. As such, the following features are officially planned:

* Ability to merge Houses under a new Superior House
* Ability to set order of Inheritance and requirements.
* Ability to have elections only be voted on by Heads of Houses
* Ability to have realms only allow inheritance to others in the House.
