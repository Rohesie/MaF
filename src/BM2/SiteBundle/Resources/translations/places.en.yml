 intro:      From here you can formally create a new place at this location, either inside a settlement if you're in one, or outside one if you are not. Your choices are limited by your location, and your roles in the various realms you are a part of, as well as certain restrictions on where each place can be built and what they each require.<br /><br />Please be advised, both capitals and embassies require you to be in a realm.

  intro:     Anyone with permission of the local lord can create a place of interest. Places of interest are semi-permanent, player created, in-game locations that share many functions with settlements. Eventually these will be expanded to allow realms to do customized introductions for new players with separate arrival descriptions, as well as exist as the gateway to player complexes which will allow you describe your world in more detail than ever before.
