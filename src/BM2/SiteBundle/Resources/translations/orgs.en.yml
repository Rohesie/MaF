  motto: Perhaps a battlecry for the order, or common chant of the faith? Something your association will be known to say or represent.
  founder: This is the rank name for your character's rank within the association.
  description:
   short: The short description is used anywhere the game needs to be brief. Depending on how you structure this association, it may not show anywhere.
   full: The full description is used primarily on the association details page, but depending on how you structure this association, it may not be visible even there.
  rankname: The name of the rank. Ideally, these are unique in the association, but that's entirely up to you.
  rankdesc: The description of the rank. Flavor text.
  viewAll: Granting this means that this rank can view all other ranks and view the members who hold those ranks. This overrides the view up, view down, and view self settings.

   header: Formalize a New Association
   intro: <p>Associations are a term of many meanings within Might & Fealty. They represent any player organization that is not representing a government (realms) or familial-esque (houses) structure. In other words, these are the guilds, cults, brotheroods, secret societies, religions, orders, companies, and corps you'd find in other games.</p><p>It should be worth noting that one option here has fairly reaching impact. Unlike Houses and Realms which are, by design, public, Associations need not be. You can decide the moment you create it that you don't want this association to be Public, and that only members of it should know about it.</p><p>Finally, there is one last thing you should understand about Associations in M&F. Type is only what your association styles itself as, and has no formal functionality beyond that. You can be the Gold Star Merchant Company that believes in a pantheon or a Temple of Fire Lake that operates exclusively to sell mercenary contracts. How your Association works is entirely up to you to decide.</p>
  createRank:
   header: Create a New Rank within the Association
   intro: <p>Ranks are a simple thing that help you manage the structure of the organization. Some of these options are overruled by association laws (like Rank Visibility and viewability) while others always take effect. If you're unsure what an option does, additional help is available for each.</p>
  faith:
   name: Declare Your Faith
   intro: You can always decide that you simply which to, at least nominally, follow one faith or another that you're part of. Any Association that you are a member of that has named what their faith and followers is called is eligible to pick from. All regions you own will follow your choice here.
   success: You've successfully changed your official religion to that of %faith%.
   success2: You've successfully changed your official religion to that of not having one.

   desc:   Look through the ranks you know of.
   description:  Associations can be completely transparent or absolutely arcane, by design. Unless you run the association, this is only the ranks you've been allowed to see by whoever created the rank you hold, if you even hold one. Unlike realms, there's no retiring ranks, and no history of them.
   empty:  If there's nothing here it is probably because you don't hold a rank of your own. You should reach out to whoever invited you or approved your joining to fix this.

   header: Join an Association
   intro: <p>Associations are a term of many meanings within Might & Fealty. They represent any player organization that is not representing a government (realms) or familial-esque (houses) structure. In other words, these are the guilds, cults, brotheroods, secret societies, religions, orders, companies, and corps you'd find in other games.</p><p>Unlike other games, these entities tend to be very free form. Functionally, they all have access to the same options, a mercenary company can have a patron saint or a temple can run trade routes--this is up to the association to decide.</p>

  newDeity:
   name:  Formalize a New Deity
   header: Formalize a New Deity
   intro: <p>Deities are known things in Might & Fealty, for all First Ones trace their lineage back to the moment they were created by one deity or another. Whether or not you follow a deity is up to you, but the existence of deities beyond this realm is fact. How you interpret that is up to you.</p><p>Warning: No real world or clearly from popular fiction religions. This is a game. Make up something new or interesting.</p>

   empty: <p>Here you can review all the deities currently recognized by the Association, and if you run this association, also remove them from recognition.</p><p>Unforunately, it doesn't look like there are any currently recognized. Perhaps this association doesn't care for religion? Or maybe it just hasn't had time to figure things out.</p>
