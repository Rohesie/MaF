   name: A short, and easily referred to, name for the association.
   formalname: The formal, and likely long, name for the association.
   type: Separate from how it functions, this is what you style it as, and changes how the game refers to it.
   public: Is the organization intended to be public knowledge? Should anyone be able to view basic details on it?
   motto: Perhaps a battlecry for the order, or common chant of the faith? Something your association will be known to say or represent.
   founder: This is the rank name for your character's rank within the association.
  description:
   short: The short description is used anywhere the game needs to be brief. Depending on how you structure this association, it may not show anywhere.
   full: The full description is used primarily on the association details page, but depending on how you structure this association, it may not be visible even there.
