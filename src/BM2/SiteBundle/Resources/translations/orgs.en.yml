   intro: <p>Associations are a term of many meanings within Might & Fealty. They represent any player organization that is not representing a government (realms) or familial-esque (houses) structure. In other words, these are the guilds, cults, brotheroods, secret societies, religions, orders, companies, and corps you'd find in other games.</p><p>It should be worth noting that one option here has fairly reaching impact. Unlike Houses and Realms which are, by design, public, Associations need not be. You can decide the moment you create it that you don't want this association to be Public, and that only members of it should know about it.</p><p>Finally, there is one last thing you should understand about Associations in M&F. Type is only what your association styles itself as, and has no formal functionality beyond that. You can be the Gold Star Merchant Company that believes in a pantheon or a Temple of Fire Lake that operates exclusively to sell mercenary contracts. How your Association works is entirely up to you to decide.</p>
