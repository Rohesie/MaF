 intro: >
   You have come upon a dungeon, a dangerous place of adventure and treasure. Higher nobility avoids these dirty holes,
   and mortals are afraid of them, but young or desperate First Ones seek them for the experience and treasures they
   contain.<br />
   For sheer survival, you can join other First Ones and enter this dungeon together, fighting your way into its depths
   until you beat it or it beats you. Teamwork is key. <br />

areaintro:
 cave: >
   This place is a natural cave, filled mostly with wild animals. Still, there can be treasures here, mostly from
   the corpses of people killed for food by the creatures inside, or from those who ventured into the caves before,
   and failed.
 wild: >
   This is an area of untamed wilderness, where you will find animals and strange creatures of nature. There are often
   treasures once belonging to travellers lost, or shiny things gathered by the inhabitants of these unexplored reaches.
 ruin: >
   Ancient ruins whose purpose is hard to guess at. Maybe it was a castle once, or a temple. There may still be valuables
   inside, either ancient treasures or belongings of those who tried to take them and died trying. For there is no saying
   what kind of creatures you may find inside.
 dungeon: > 
   An entrance guides you down. It is impossible to guess why someone would build an underground lair at a place like this,
   nor what it was for. You are certain that treasures are hidden inside, just as you are sure that they are well guarded.
 lab: >
   You're not quite sure who built this ancient labyrinth or what purpose it holds, but certainly it was built for a reason,
   and anything of such size that has drawn such monsters to it must contain vast hoards of wealth. Some of the things you
   see wandering inside don't even seem to understand they're lost within, as if they were under some sort of spell.
 citadel: >
   This ancient citadel was so well built that not only is it still standing, it's still standing despite the hoards of
   monsters that appear to have made it their home. Surely, even with all the fiends patrolling it, it must have something
   of worth within it's monster filled halls.
 hold: >
   When you approached this place, you were fairly certain the local authorities had built it, but now that you're closer
   you can be quite certain that it's been taken over by a local brigand and his gang.
 glade: >
   When you imagine a glade, you don't normally expect it to be filled to the brim with monsters. But here you are, in a
   monster filled clearing. Time to draw that weapon of yours, no?
 roguefort: >
   It doesn't happen very often, but occassionally one of those mortals gets some crazy idea in his head about how he can
   can rule himself. Somehow, he manages to get a bunch of soldiers from the local garrisons to join him in his crazy idea
   and now you end up with situations like this, were you and a few of your compatriots have deceided to teach the fool a
   lesson about who's in charge.
 mausoleum: >
   This impressive stone mausoleum must have taken the work of hundreds of people over hundreds of days to build. Perhaps
   the last resting place of a forgotten monarch or even the tomb of a civilization, it contains untold treasures entrusted
   to eternity alongside the dead. And untold dangers as its passages and halls have been colonized by all manner of strange
   and vicious creatures.
 shipgrave: >
   When ships reached the end of their seaworthy lives, they were brought here to be broken up and scavenged for parts that
   could be reused. Thought to be stripped of everything that could be used again, who knows what hidden treasures could have
   been missed hidden in the broken hulks. The wreaks also make excellent dens for the creatures of the wild that have made
   them their homes.
 flooded: >
   Once a thriving town, this place became the victim of a sudden shift in tides and water levels. Swiftly abandoned by a
   fleeing population, all manner of items that were left behind wait to be discovered.

monsterdesc:
 arachnid: >
   These are not your typical household spiders, these are monsters. The small ones are as big as a cat, the large ones
   rival a wolf, and all of them have a thick exosceleton, fangs, spider webs and everything else that ensures you will
   have nightmares about them long after you have escaped. If you escape.
 bandit: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. They can have a variety of weapons and armor and
   can be dangerous enemies as they know the territory and consider it their home. Especially in larger groups, they can
   be quite dangerous.
 bandita: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. These bandit archers sport a variety of ranged weapons
   as well as some secondary weapons and light armor for melee combat. They can be dangerous enemies as they know the 
   territory and consider it their home. Especially in larger groups, they can be quite dangerous.
 banditb: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. These outlaw leaders add experience and better equipment
   to the mix, making them quite formidable opponents. Since they know the territory and consider it their home, you should
   expect dirty fighting and trickery.
 banditg: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. These bandit guards have the nasty habit of being capable
   with a variety of weapons, and also tending to be accompanied by an assortment of beasts.
 barghest: >
   At first glance, the barghest looks like a large, dirty wolf. But if you get closer, you understand he is nothing like a
   wolf. These creatures are hunters of beasts twice their size, their teeth are like daggers and their hide is thick. They
   are covered in scars and legendary for being able to take a full sword blow and yet remain standing.
 bat: >
   Dire bats are more than just large bats, they also have fangs the size of small knives and they are not only unafraid of
   humans, they seem to enjoy human blood as a meal. Attacking from the air, they can be quite difficult to hit.
 bear: >
   Taller than a human, much stronger and easily angered, bears are not to be underestimated. They may be a bit slow,
   and prefer to live alone, but their strength is legendary and they can be quite brutal.
 beetle: >
   A swarm of fire beetles, each one the size of a mouse and with a poisonous bite that makes wounds feel as if they burn.
   These creatures can cause a surprising amount of pain for their small size, and you never meet just one.
 cat: >
   Tiger, leopard, lion, panther, lynx - who can spot the difference? These cats are big, agile and dangerous. They are faster
   than many other animals and they are predators that combine stealth and speed into a package that should not be
   taken lightly.
 chimera: >
   It's hard to tell exactly what the main type of monster this is, but it appears to be a very . . . interesting, combination
   of several very nasty, very deadly monsters.
 crazy: >
   Something has driven this man insane, and he is not to be argued with. He will attack on sight with whatever he can find,
   sticks, stones or bare hands. Best to put him out of his misery.
 dragon: >
   Of all the beasts that you can encounter, the dragon is the one that you hear most often of people seeing, not slaying.
   Everything that you've heard about dragons, seems to be a statement of fact as you look upon the magnificent creature.
 dog: >
   A trained guard dog, clearly left here by someone or something that wants to be aware if someone tries sneaking up.
   Its not much a threat to a trained adventurer, but it's masters certainly might be.
 eagle: >
   These giant eagles can grow to a surprising size, and hunt sheep, deer or even cows for food. They can be quite a match
   even for a well-armed First One, especially if encountered in groups. When they swoop down on you, take cover.
 falcon: >
   A trained hawk, probably the servant of someone, somewhere. Not that any of that matters since its attacking you.
 fortguard: >
   A simple footman in the service of their lord. It's unlikely they really understand their responsibilities or who they're
   serving. Equipped with a standard-issue infantry weapon.
 fortguarda: >
   A simple footman in the service of their lord. It's unlikely they really understand their responsibilities or who they're
   serving. Equipped with a standard-issue ranged weapon.
 fortguardc: >
   A guard captain in the service of their lord. It's possible that this individual might have some idea of the scope of their
   responsibility. Regardless, they're a versatile and able combatant.
 fortguardh: >
   A heavy infantryman in the service of their lord. Clearly more capable than the footmen you've encountered previously.
   Their heavier armor looks like it could take some blows, and their weapons appear to be sharper, even moreso than their
   captain's armament.
 fortguardv: >
   A veteran soldier in the service of their lord. Between the scars and the way they carry themselves, this individual has
   not only seen serious combat, but survived well enough to talk about it. Even their younger captains seem to show them
   an amount of respect, uncommon to the rest of their company.
 fortguardhv: >
   A veteran heavy infantryman in the service of their lord. Between the scars the way they carry themselves, they're clearly
   more capable than the footment you've encountered previously. Their armor looks sturdier, their weapons better maintained,
   their eyes sharper, and their reflexes more attuned to your attacks. 
 fortcavalry: >
   A cavalryman in the service of their lord. It's unlikely they really understand their responsibilities or who they're
   serving. Equipped with a standard-issue infantry weapon.
 fortcavlarya: > 
   A cavalryman in the service of their lord. It's unlikely they really understand their responsibilities or who they're
   serving. Equipped with a standard-issue ranged weapon.
 fortcavalryc: >
   A cavalry captain in the service of their lord. It's possible that this individual might have some idea of the scope of their
   responsibility. Regardless, they're a versatile and able combatant.
 fortcavalryh: >
   A heavy cavalryman in the service of their lord. Clearly more capable than the cavalrymen you've encountered previously.
   Their heavier armor looks like it could take some blows, and their weapons appear to be sharper, even moreso than their
   captain's armament.
 fortlord: >
   Its a rare occurence, but every so often one of the mortals gets some idea that they can be you, and they start trying to do
   absurd things like rule themselves--and not just their local settlement either. Left uncheck, who knows what this mortal could
   pull off. Best end them now.
 fortlesslord: >
   You know what they say about slimes, how if there's one there's more. Apparently the same thing happens when mortals get crazy
   ideas about self-governance.
 hawk: >
   A large hawk, which seems to be bent on making you it's dinner. The talons on it seem capable of making that a distinct
   possibility.
 lost: >
   A lost hero of old times, this elite warrior has been mentally damaged by all the carnage he has seen and caused. He has
   retreated to this hiding place, maybe he even fought here one time, and has lost himself in a world of his own. He will
   attack any intruders, and cannot be reasoned with anymore. He is an experienced and dangerous enemy.
 mongrel: >
   A stray dog, having gone feral from lack of proper care or attention. Now, it is little more than a wild beast.
 monhunter: >
   Mortals who specialize in hunting dangerous beasts or monsters for profit or amusement. They usually sport  longbows and 
   javelins as well as using a wide range of potent poisons. Often seen working along dungeoneers.
 npcdungeoneer: >
   Mortals who raid dungeons  for profit or other nefarious purposes. Having faced numerous dangers in their life, they are 
   fearless, ruthless, highly disciplined and more well equipped than most elite soldiers, making them a formidable foe. 
 ogre: >
   Nobody knows what these creatures truly are. While they look like huge, ugly humans, they show no sign of human intelligence
   and the usage of clubs is the only sign that they may be smarter than most animals. They avoid humans, but if cornered
   they are ruthless fighters, and can take an enormous amount of damage before they fall.
 rat: >
   The slime of the animal world.
 shaman: >
   Practitioners of mystic, dark, or the occult, shamans have been around almost as long as society. Whether or not their ways
   actually work doesn't matter, just having one around can have an effect on things.
 slime: >
   Its a pretty standard green slime. They seem to be able to get basically anywhere.
 snake: >
   Some are small, some weigh more than a human and are several metres long. Many are poisonous, making them even more
   dangerous. Snakes love damp, dark places and can be a nasty surprise for anyone not expecting them.
 troglodyte: >
   One of the strangest creatures of the wild, a troglodyte looks like an unholy crossbreed between a human and a lizard. They
   have a basic humanoid shape, but ash-grey reptilian skin, a salamander head and a lizard tail. They do not appear to possess
   more than basic intelligence, not do they communicate with more than grunts. As enemies, they are very dangerous as they can
   attack with claws and bites at the same time, and sometimes make use of clubs or other primitive weapons.
 villager: >
   You're not sure why this villager has taken up arms, or why they are using said arms against you, but does it really matter?
 wolf: >
   Wild canines that are excellent pack-hunters and highly territorial. As much as one wolf is not very dangerous for
   anyone with a sword and armor, a pack of wolves is bad news even for the well-equipped.
 wolfb: >
   Dire wolves are more than just bigger wolves, they are also incredibly aggressive and much tougher. Their thick skin
   is used as leather armor by some tribes, provided you can actually slay such a beast.
 wyvern: >
   Often mistaken for dragons, the wyvern looks much like a bat with a longer neck and lizard snout from up close. Not that
   you want to get close, as these flying reptile monsters are incredibly dangerous and their sharp talons can cut through
   even metal armor. In the air, they are agile and fast, though on the ground less so. But even wounded and downed, they
   are some of the most dangerous creatures of the wilderness.
